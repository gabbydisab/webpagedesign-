	<b> <h4> Reviews/Quotes </b> </h4> </p>
	<ul>
	<!-- quotes and reviews from people who have visited and all of the good things they experienced during their trip-->
	<li> <q> "We visited the trifecta of Herculaneum, Pompeii and the Archaeological Meseum in Naples. Great combination, but Herculaneum was tops for me. We hired a terrific guide for only a 10 per person on top of the entrance fee. I recommend the guide! </q> -Bryan S </li>
	<li> <q> "We've visited 2-3 ago Pompeii and decided to skip Herculaneum as we've thought one is enough. Sometimes you can be very wrong. If you have to make a decision which one to visit, we would prefer Herculaneum to Pompeii. </q> -Bonsai75 </li>
	<li> <q> If you have a afternoon and want an experience that is different from visiting Pompeii then the ruins of Herculaneum may be for you. In my opinion, Herculaneum gives you a more comprehensive look at an ancient city. </q> -Dbabe </li>
