<main> 

<p>Yorkies are easy dogs to carry around!!! Also they do not eat as much as other dogs so there is no need to spend a ton of money on dog food! Like many terriers, Yorkies are lively and have a delightful temperament. Along with them being lively they are also cuddly! Not too many breeds of dogs like to be carried or cuddled, but Yorkies like nothing better to be held in your arms. </p>
